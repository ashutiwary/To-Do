# Todo List Application

A simple and interactive Todo List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and save their progress using local storage.

## Features:
- Add tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed (cross out text).
- Delete tasks.
- Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage and persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Files:
1. **index.html** - The main HTML file that contains the structure of the Todo List app.
2. **style.css** - The CSS file responsible for styling the application, including layout, colors, and transitions.
3. **script.js** - The JavaScript file that contains the functionality of adding, deleting, toggling completion of tasks, and saving data to local storage.

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. Add tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the **Add** button.
4. Click on a task to toggle its completion status (crossing out the text).
5. Click the **Delete** button on a task to remove it from the list.
6. The list is automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so tasks will persist even after you refresh the page.
